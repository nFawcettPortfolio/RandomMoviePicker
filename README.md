# RandomMoviePicker
This was just a fun little WinForms app that I just did quickly, after being indecisive about what movie to watch. It uses StreamWriter to save strings into a text document, and StreamReader to read them upon loading. The Random Button will pick a movie at random, and highlight, so it can easily be removed from the list.
